Too many pin codes to remember? Too much hassle storing and getting them from your password manager?

Pinapple is an easy and safe Android app that remembers pin codes for you.

### Easy
No need to remember difficult master passwords. Forget typing long passwords on your mobile device. Simply choose a four digit passcode and keep using that to view and save your PIN codes.

### Safe
Different passcodes will show different PIN codes and the passcode is never stored on your device so there is no way for an attacker to figure out which passcode is yours.
